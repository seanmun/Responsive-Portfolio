                            Always wanted to get around to creating my own personal site from scratch, finally! I work at an advertising agency in Center City named, Digitas Health. It's one of the largest in the field of pharmaceutical advertising. My position there is Director, Marketing Operations. I focus primarily on CRM and Email Marketingâ€”including strategy, design, development, execution and reporting. <br><br>
                            A few years ago, I was having trouble with our internal dev team. A lot of errors were being made and budgets were getting blow up due to HTML dev delays. So I started teaching myself HTML and CSS and gradually took over the workload. A few years later, I'm now cranking out upwards of 100 emails per year. Lately, I've been really pushing the envelope with interactive emails.

                        However, email development is very niche. There are so many restrictions and bugs from inbox/device rendering engines, it becomes extremely difficult to code. I use so many hacks I have a hard time performing "normal" html/css structure. I signed up for this class because I'm ready to take the next step. I'm ready to graduate from email development.                </p>
